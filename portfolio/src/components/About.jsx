      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Tonnia Scott</strong> — an aspiring full-stack web developer and future data analyst. 
        I’m passionate about turning ideas into interactive experiences and uncovering insights through data.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a BS in Applied Mathematics and I’m currently completing the NPower Full Stack Development course, 
        where I’m building skills in modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. 
        Alongside web development, I’m teaching myself SQL and Python to prepare for a career in data analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe AI is shaping the future, and I’m excited to learn more about how it can be applied to problem-solving, 
        automation, and creating smarter solutions. My goal is to combine software development, data analysis, 
        and AI knowledge to make a real-world impact.
      </p>

        <em>I’m always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on meaningful projects — let’s connect!</em>
